I am a product engineer at _Netflix_. I joined back in 2011 to build social integration from scratch which is covered [here](http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/watch-this-now-netflix-facebook.html), [here](http://blog.netflix.com/2013/03/introducing-netflix-social.html) and [here](http://blog.netflix.com/2014/09/got-any-good-recommendations.html). Currently I am part of the team that is responsible for social and personalization infrastructure. Before Netflix I worked at _Yahoo! Search_.

Apart from work some of my current interests include,

* Clojure
* Running
* Eating
* Cricket
* Poker
* Tennis
* Streaming tv-shows
